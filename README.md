# Cube-Viz
The main goal of this project is a web application for
a rubiks cube puzzle, hopefully with more features added 
over time.

# Installation
To run locally, first run:

```
npm install
```

Aftwards, run:

```
npm run dev
```

You can then follow the link to see the cube in your browser.

# Controls

For the camera controls you can simply click and drag to spin the cube around, zoom in on mousewheel, and holding ctrl you can reposition. 

Utilizing [common cubing notation](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/), the controls are currently:

```
h - L
j - U
k - D
l - R
u - F
i - B
```

By holding shift you can also do prime moves as well :)
